        <p>Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful<br>
            And every night has its day, so magical<br>
            And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle<br>
            That can't be defeated<br>
            For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable<br>
            In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle<br>
            For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable<br>
            With something to believe in<br>
            Monday left me broken<br>
            Tuesday, I was through with hoping<br>
            Wednesday, my empty arms were open<br>
            Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love<br>
            Thank the stars it's Friday<br>
            I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday<br>
            Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday<br>
            I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around<br>
            We are one of a kind, irreplaceable<br>
            How did I get so blind and so cynical?<br>
            If there's love in this life, we're unstoppable<br>
            No, we can't be defeated<br>
            Monday left me broken<br>
            Tuesday, I was through with hoping<br>
            Wednesday, my empty arms were open<br>
            Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love<br>
            Thank the stars it's Friday<br>
            I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday<br>
            Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday<br>
            I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around</p>
