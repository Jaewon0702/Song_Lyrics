        <p>Once upon a younger year<br>
            When all our shadows disappeared<br>
            The animals inside came out to play<br>
            Went face to face with all our fears<br>
            Learned our lessons through the tears<br>
            Made memories we knew would never fade<br>
            One day my father, he told me<br>
            "Son, don't let it slip away"<br>
            He took me in his arms, I heard him say<br>
            "When you get older<br>
            Your wild heart will live for younger days<br>
            Think of me if ever you're afraid"<br>
            He said: "One day you'll leave this world behind<br>
            So live a life you will remember"<br>
            My father told me when I was just a child<br>
            "These are the nights that never die"
            My father told me<br>
            When thunder clouds start pouring down<br>
            Light a fire they can't put out<br>
            Carve your name into those shining stars<br>
            He said: "Go venture far beyond the shores<br>
            Don't forsake this life of yours<br>
            I'll guide you home, no matter where you are"
            One day my father, he told me<br>
            "Son, don't let it slip away"<br>
            When I was just a kid, I heard him say<br>
            "When you get older<br>
            Your wild heart will live for younger days<br>
            Think of me if ever you're afraid"<br>
            He said: "One day you'll leave this world behind<br>
            So live a life you will remember"<br>
            My father told me when I was just a child<br>
            "These are the nights that never die"<br>
            My father told me<br>
            "These are the nights that never die"<br>
            My father told me<br>
            My father told me<br>
            </p>
