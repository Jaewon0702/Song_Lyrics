        <p>Feeling my way through the darkness<br>
            Guided by a beating heart<br>
            I can't tell where the journey will end<br>
            But I know where to start<br>
            They tell me I'm too young to understand<br>
            They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
            Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br>
            Well that's fine by me<br>
            So wake me up when it's all over<br>
            When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
            All this time I was finding myself<br>
            And I didn't know I was lost<br>
            So wake me up when it's all over<br>
            When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
            All this time I was finding myself<br>
            And I didn't know I was lost<br>
            I tried carrying the weight of the world<br>
            But I only have two hands<br>
            Hope I get the chance to travel the world<br>
            But I don't have any plans<br>
            Wish that I could stay forever this young<br>
            Not afraid to close my eyes<br>
            Life's a game made for everyone<br>
            And love is a prize<br>
            So wake me up when it's all over<br>
            When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
            All this time I was finding myself<br>
            And I didn't know I was lost<br>
            So wake me up when it's all over<br>
            When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
            All this time I was finding mysel<br>f
            And I didn't know I was lost<br>
            I didn't know I was lost<br>
            I didn't know I was lost<br>
            I didn't know I was lost<br>
            I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know</p>
