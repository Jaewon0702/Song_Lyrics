        <p>Under the tree where the grass don't grow<br>
            We made a promise to never get old<br>
            You had a chance, and you took it on me<br>
            And I made a promise that I couldn't keep<br>
            Heartache, heartbreak, all over town<br>
            But something flipped like a switch when you came around<br>
            And I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together, oh<br>
            These are the days we've been waiting for<br>
            On days like these, who could ask for more?<br>
            Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet<br>
            These are the days we won't regret<br>
            These are the days we won't forget<br>
            These are the days we've been waiting for<br>
            Rattle the cage, and slam that door<br>
            And the world is calling us, but not just yet<br>
            These are the days we won't regret<br>
            These are the days we won't forget<br>
            Out on the midnight, the wild ones howl<br>
            The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel<br>
            We used to believe we were stars aligned<br>
            You made a wish, and I fell out of-<br>
            Time flew, cut through, all over town<br>
            You make me bleed when I look up, and you're not around<br>
            But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together, oh<br>
            These are the days we've been waiting for<br>
            On days like these, who could ask for more<br>
            Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet<br>
            These are the days we won't regret<br>
            These are the days we won't forget<br>
            These are the days we've been waiting for<br>
            Neither of us knows what's in store<br>
            You just roll your window down, and place your bets<br>
            These are the days we won't regret<br>
            These are the days we'll never forget<br>
            And these are the days (These are the days)<br>
            And these are the days, eh (These are the days)</p>
